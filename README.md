# Kid Court
This is a world governed by kids. In this experience, you will be dropped in the kid court, which is the best play to feel the kid's power. You will be playing the suspect of violating the "Anti-Candy Waste Low", and getting the chance to take a look at the court and find what is going on in this interesting kid world. 

## Technical setup instructions

This is a unity-based environmental storytelling project. The user will start by standing at the center of the room. The user can turn around their view to see the whole picture of the room, or they can focus on some details that they are interested in. Then, the user can get a sense of the environmental storytelling inside the space and enjoy the related narrative. Hope you enjoy this space! (The ideal watching sequence is watching the hammer → the scale → the TV → your surroundings → the handcuff on the floor). 

## Special controls 

Just enjoy!
